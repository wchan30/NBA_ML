# NBA_ML
The nbaml.py code extracts data from the NBA API and uses KNN in order to predict wins for an NBA team. The team that I am using currently is
the Golden State Warriors. Any team can be used by finding the team_id in the NBA API.


The nbaplot.py code plots a linear regression graph comparing two nba stats. The two variables that I've compared are Turnovers (TOV) and Field
Goal Percentage (FG_PCT). You can change these arguments into any two stat categories you like.
